# GROUP TWO TO-DO APP
### ⚡ WHAT IS A TODO APP ?
A to-do app is a digital tool that helps you organize and manage your tasks, projects. It allows you to create and prioritize a list of things you need to do, set reminders, and track your progress. You can also use a to-do app to assign tasks to others, share lists, and collaborate with team members. Overall, a to-do app is a helpful tool for individuals' and teams to stay organized,keep activity track and be productive in the end.


### ⚡ PROJECT SUMMARY _ OUR UNDERSTANDING

Based on the given requirements, the project developed a to-do application using the Django framework for the back-end and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end. The application allows users to create and manage daily or weekly lists of tasks, mark tasks as completed or skipped, and set reminders for specific tasks via email notifications. The application also allowed users to delete tasks and automatically removed tasks older than seven days.

In terms of user stories, the project was broken down into several stories including user account creation, task creation and management, task completion and skipping, task reminders, task deletion, and task auto-removal. Each story was further broken down into implementation tasks such as creating database models, building user interfaces, implementing email notifications, and configuring deployment settings.

To implement this project, an agile software development framework such as Extreme Programming (XP) was used. The development team worked collaboratively to prioritize user stories, estimate and plan implementation tasks, conduct iterative development, and continuously test and deploy the application.

The development process was divided into sprints, each lasting approximately one to two weeks, with each sprint focusing on delivering a set of user stories. The project plan was updated after each sprint to reflect progress made, issues encountered, and any changes to the scope or timeline.

Overall, the project aimed to deliver a user-friendly and functional to-do application that met the given requirements and adhered to best practices for software development.
